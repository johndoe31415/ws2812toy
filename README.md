# ws2812toy
Mood light built with an ATmega88P with a 18.432 MHz external crystal
(important for timing!) that connects to an LED ring with 32 WS2812 RGB LEDs on
pin PB0. Needs a button attached to PC3 and has a power indicator on PC4. A
keypress indicates the mode briefly (shows a constant color for 500ms), then
switches into the actual mode (e.g., slowly fading rainbow colors).
